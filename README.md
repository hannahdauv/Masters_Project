**Thermal Conductivity Analysis using LAMMPS and Python**

Overview:
This repository contains LAMMPS simulation files and Python scripts used in my master's project on minimizing thermal conduction in artificial disordered materials. The project involves molecular dynamics simulations to study thermal conductivity using the Green-Kubo method and Lennard-Jones potentials.

Project Objectives:
Investigate thermal conductivity variations in disordered materials.
Use LAMMPS to run molecular dynamics simulations.
Post-process data using Python for analysis, including heat flux autocorrelation and radial distribution functions (RDFs).
Compare results for different Lennard-Jones parameter variations.
